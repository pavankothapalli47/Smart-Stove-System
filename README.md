# Smart-Stove-System
My project detects the gas when there is any leakage and turns off the regulator of the gas cylinder or the stove knob and prevent any further damage. It also helps to detect the amount of gas present in the cylinder and alert the user beforehand.  An additional feature is to turn off the gas after a defined amount of time. Existing methods deals with sensing the gas and turning it off by some complex procedures like using a turtle bot, etc. There is no remote method to the gas leakage or regulator knob. Existing methods highly deal with industrial gas leakage issues. I am going to solve this problem by using IOT and mobile applications, we provide a remote method to off the gas cylinderâ€™s regulator knob. We also use GSM technology to send messages for booking gas cylinders. The scope of our project is limited to the domestic purpose.
